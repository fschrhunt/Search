# Changelog

## Unreleased

- The first Rust implementation: one binary serving multi-provider discovery, a
  hardened fetcher, a private full-text index, and MCP over stdio and HTTP.
- Release tooling: `scripts/release.sh` (name the changelog section, then tag),
  `scripts/formula.sh` (the Homebrew formula), and `install.sh` (the
  checksum-verified installer), with CI and a tag workflow that builds archives,
  attests provenance, updates the formula, and installs the release.
- Documentation and contribution: `CONTRIBUTING.md`, `docs/` for users and
  `docs/contributing/` for the project, issue and pull-request templates, and a
  `./x check` that includes a shell-syntax check.
